# Count de Money :money_mouth_face:
Level 1 Javascript Project

### Project Requirements
● The page should have a proper display using HTML.

● The page should show a log of each of the numbers already guessed.

● The page should show a log of the hot/cold responses for each of the numbers already
guessed.

● The page should show the player’s current guess.

● The page should have buttons for adding and subtracting 1, 5, and 10, and 25 to and
from the current guess.

● The number of guesses remaining.

● The page should have a “commit” button.

● The page should have a “reset” button.

### Project Enhancements
Just for fun, let’s make the computer mischievous. Whenever the user makes a guess, there is a 5% chance that the computer will lie about the result. Generate a random
response and add that to the log.

If the response should be very hot and the computer lies about it, the user will still not be penalized a guess.
